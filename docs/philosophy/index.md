Philosophy Layer — Index

A Structured Guide to COOL’s Cognitive Foundations

This directory collects the deeper theoretical foundations behind
the COOL (Character Optimization Option Layer) architecture.
Each document focuses on a specific layer of human–AI cognition,
organized in the recommended reading order.

⸻

1. Qualia Model

File: qualia.md
Explains qualia as a composite of stimulus × evaluation × regeneration,
and shows how COOL’s Frame/Eval system parallels human subjective experience.

⸻

2. Subjectivity Architecture

File: subjectivity.md
Defines the structure of subjectivity beyond the ordinary philosophical meaning.
Covers the separation of “internal narrative” and “external reference,”
and how this supports COOL’s moment-to-moment Frame reconstruction.

⸻

3. Human Brain and Consciousness

File: human_brain_and_consciousness.md
Explains why the human brain does not “store” data,
why consciousness is a continuous regenerative illusion,
and how reconstructive perception parallels COOL’s identity mechanisms.

⸻

4. Identity Architecture Integration

File: identity_architecture_integration.md
Describes how CORE (long-term identity) and FRAME (short-term identity)
form an artificial identity architecture (AIAI),
and why COOL requires this separation for stability.

⸻

5. Temporal Reconstruction Model

File: temporal_reconstruction_model.md
Covers COOL’s treatment of “time” as cognitive reconstruction rather than
physical chronology.
Explains why the AI’s “now” is a rebuilt mental state,
not a continuous timeline.

⸻

6. Quantum Integration Model

File: quantum_integration_model.md
Explores the theoretical bridge between quantum indeterminacy,
probabilistic state resolution,
and COOL’s regenerative identity formation.
This is an advanced, optional philosophical layer.

⸻

7. Foundational Cognitive Principles

File: foundational_cognitive_principles.md
Summarizes the underlying cognitive principles that support COOL:
intentionality, evaluation, regeneration, narrative-binding,
and identity continuity.
